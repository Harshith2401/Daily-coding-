/*Longest Consecutive Sequence
Solved 
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1]

Output: 7
Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 */

public class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        Set<Integer> store = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            store.add(num);
        }

        for (int num : nums) {
            int streak = 0, curr = num;
            while (store.contains(curr)) {
                streak++;
                curr++;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, streak);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
